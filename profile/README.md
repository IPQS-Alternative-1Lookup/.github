### What if the 1Lookup Coupon Does Not Work?

3. **Clear your browser cache** or try logging in using an incognito window.
4. **Contact 1Lookup support**—they offer real human support tailored for SMBs to help resolve billing issues quickly, unlike the automated ticket systems of larger legacy providers.

## What are 1Lookup Pricing Plans?

## More Ways to Save on 1Lookup

Besides relying on bulk volume discounts, here are a few smart ways to save more on your fraud prevention setup:

### 1. Maximize Your Free Credits

Run a sample of your highest-risk traffic through the 1,000 free lookups first. This allows you to directly benchmark 1Lookup's proxy and VPN detection against your current IPQS data before spending a dime.

### 2. Combine Validation Steps

Because 1Lookup uses Universal Credits, you can perform an IP reputation check, clean your email lists, and run an HLR phone lookup all from the same prepaid balance without needing multiple expensive software subscriptions.

### 3. Implement Web Form API

Instead of paying to scrub massive databases of old leads, implement the 1Lookup API directly onto your signup forms. Blocking fake numbers and disposable emails in real-time saves you from paying for CRM storage and SMS delivery failures down the line.
